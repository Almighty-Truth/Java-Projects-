# Java-Projects-  in the BingoGame (Driver) class will loop to generate 50 random
numbers in the range of 1 to 75. This simulates drawing 50 numbers in a BINGO game. The method
will pass the number to a method, checkBingo() in the domain class, BingoCard, which will check if the
number received as a parameter is in the B range (1 – 15), I range (16 – 30), N range (31 – 45), G range
(46 -60) or O range (61 – 75). According to the range it is in, the method will check each of the cells in
designated column (col 0 = B; col 1 = I; col 2 = N; col 3 = G; col 4 = O). Example: randomNum 27 was
randomly generated, which belongs to the I-range, column 1, checking rows 0 to 4 

in the Bingo (Domain) class will return TRUE if 5 numbers were set to 0
either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Otherwise, the method will return FALSE
